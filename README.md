# Riddle-Bot

Riddle Bot I created for fun with my friends. The bot utilizes several Discord features and the internet in order to be completed. Total of 5 Steps. The first step takes place in the channel with all participants. The rest will take place in each participant's direct messages. Once the riddle is completed the winner will be announced in the channel the riddle command was called. 

The riddle duration is usually about 10-20 minutes.
